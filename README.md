```

### Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Install NodeJS, NPM and Docker
- Run `npm i` inside the repo folder
- Run `npm run start` to build and run the project locally

### Build
- run `npm run build` for local build
- run `npm run build:docker` for local docker build

### Run locally
- run `npm run start` for local run
- run `npm run start:docker` for local docker run


### Testing
- run `npm run test` to run all the tests
- all the test files should go inside `__test__` folder
- all test files should have `test` in name, ending with `.ts` for example `hello.test.ts`

### Deployment
Before you deploy this project, you need to configure your AWS CLI and AWS account
- create ECR repository, and push your docker image and then get the repo URL
- upload `deployment/ecs-stack.json` to Cloudformation dashboard > create on AWS
- provide the config details and ECR url and finish the stack creation
- run `sh ./deployment/parameter_store_values.sh` with all the required values filled
- run ```aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --template-body file://deployment/rds.template \
  --stack-name YourStackName``` with required values filled to create RDS postgres instance
- optionally you can run ```aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --template-body file://deployment/rds.event.template \
  --stack-name YourStackName``` to enable SMS notification for DB events
  
You can also validate the template using
```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template \
  --template-body file://deployment/rds.template
```

Once your stack is created and running, you can then configure CI/CD pipeline to run the
test `npm run test` and lint `npm run lint`, then build the docker image and push to ECR. The server deployment
will be automatically updated with the latest ECR image

-- Happy coding  ðŸ˜‰
